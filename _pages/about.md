About Me
===

Hello! I am a full time research assistant at the Michigan AI lab working with Professor [Jenna Wiens](https://websites.umich.edu/~wiensj/). I am fortunate to have [Sarah Jabbour](https://sjabbour.github.io/) as an awesome mentor! My research focuses on **machine learning with applications in healthcare.** I am currently interested in healthcare focused foundation models and their applications. I will soon be applying to Ph.D. programs with start dates in the fall of 2025. 

I earned my B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Physics from the University of Michigan in 2024. (Go Blue!) In the past, my interest in science led me to a variety of research fields. I worked on problems in computational neuroscience with Professor [Thad Polk](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/tpolk.html). I also spent a summer optimizing the construction and testing of components for CERNâ€™s upgraded muon spectrometer under the direction of Professor [Bing Zhou](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/people/faculty/bzhou.html).

Outside of research I enjoy listening to music, keeping up with current events, and cooking!

Permutation importance has been used to provide feature importance explanations for tabular-based models. Leveraging text-conditioned diffusion, we extend this framework to image-based models and facilitate dataset-level model explanations.
